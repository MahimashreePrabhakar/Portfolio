### Automatic Fluid Level Detection and Tracking for Microfluidic Applications
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

The module comprises several vital components, including a **level controller, pressure sensor, valve driver, temperature sensor, and a CAN interface**. The level controller serves the purpose of precisely regulating the fluid level within the burette. For accurate fluid readings, an **IR sensor** is strategically positioned around the burette, connected to a **motorized slide potentiometer**.To improve the accuracy of fluid level readings obtained from the level controller, a **PID** control system is implemented, effectively reducing any offset. Finally, for seamless communication with other modules, the input module utilizes the **CAN protocol**, enabling efficient data exchange and coordination across the entire system.
